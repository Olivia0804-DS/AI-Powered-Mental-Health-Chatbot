# AI-Powered-Mental-Health-Chatbot

The primary aim of this initiative is to improve post-discharge outcomes and reduce costs by empowering allied health professionals to actively manage and provide remote support to patients after their discharge from the hospital. One transformative aspect of the programme involves leveraging technology to provide personalised, just-in-time coaching methodologies aimed at encouraging and guiding patients towards better adherence and lifestyle changes.
